## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[N/A]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[The challenge which I found more than an obstacle to continue my previous work was step number 7 in which I had to add sounds to the buttons in the game.
It was an obstacle because it was my first time working with sounds inside javascript. My problem was that the buttons at the end of the code did not emit any sound. 
This led me to review each word and symbol to know what I had done wrong. 
Thanks to the tutorial I was able to get ahead but it was a bit overwhelming experience because I had to do it all over again]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[I have 3 questions about web development, 
1. If I qualify for this program will I eventually have professional level knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript? 
2. Apart from HTML, CSS and Javascript, will we learn something else? 
3. If later during the program I find myself with a stronger challenge, can I opt for the help of a tutor?]]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[I would have liked to improvise in adding more additional functions like changing color and changing from a square to an animal figure]
